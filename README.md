[My Notes](notes.md)

FFmpeg Helper is a web application to interactively generate FFmpeg commands with an intuitive UI, save generated commands, and see commands others have generated.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

FFmpeg is an incredibly powerful command-line tool for manipulating and editing media that can run on almost any platform. Unfortunately, with all this functionality and flexibilty comes a great pile of command-line options, manuals, and documentation for users to sift through. FFmpeg Helper provides a convenient UI to easily generate FFmpeg commands. Users can then save these commands for later and see what commands others have made.

### Design

```mermaid

    actor User1
    actor User2
    User1->>Website: Log in
    Website-->>User1: Logged in
    User1->>Website: Save new command
    Website-->>User2: View new command
```

### Key features

- Simple UI to select FFmpeg options
- Expose FFmpeg functionality for image, audio, and video transcoding
- Button to conveniently copy FFmpeg command to clipboard
- Allow selection of containers, codecs, and quality
- Allow saving useful commands to the user's account
- Allow browsing commands others have made
- Allow saving others' posts and seeing how many times each post has been saved
- Show updates to FFmpeg codebase

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Site layout and structure: main page, profile page, and community page, with apropriate links between them
- **CSS** - Simple, responsive, and easy-to-read UI; generated FFmpeg command displayed in terminal-style section
- **React** - Interactivity, e.g. for login, command generation, and viewing of saved commands
- **Service** - Service backend supporting login, saving generated commands, saving community commands, and viewing codebase updates (3rd party)
- **DB/Login** - Save users and their login info, as well as their saved commands, save how many times each command has been saved
- **WebSocket** - Show in real time new commands that have been saved and updates to how many times
